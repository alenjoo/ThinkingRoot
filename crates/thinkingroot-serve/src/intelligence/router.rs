// Query Router — classifies incoming queries as Fast or Agentic path.
//
// Fast path (sub-5ms):  vector search + in-memory cache lookups.
// Agentic path (200ms-2s): ReAct loop with event calendar + multi-hop reasoning.
//
// The router is a lightweight keyword-based classifier.  It runs before any
// I/O so it adds < 1µs overhead.  False positives (routing to Agentic when
// Fast would suffice) are harmless — they add latency but not errors.  False
// negatives (routing to Fast when Agentic is needed) produce less accurate
// answers, so the thresholds err on the side of over-routing to Agentic.
